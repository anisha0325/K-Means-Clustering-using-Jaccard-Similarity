# K-Means-Clustering-using-Jaccard-Similarity

### The Task

The task here is to cluster the documents via K-means clustering for different values of K and determine an optimum value of K.

As a similarity measure, Jaccard index is used. This measures similarity between two documents based on the overlap of words present in both documents.

More information about the similarity index can be found here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index

### The Data Set

In each of the text collections, each document is summarized as a bag (multiset) of words. The individual documents are identified by document IDs and the words are identified by word IDs.

After some cleaning up, in each collection the vocabulary of unique words has been truncated to only keep words that occurred more than ten times overall in that collection.
